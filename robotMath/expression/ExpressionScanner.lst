GPLEX Summary
=============================================================================
Total number of states = 9, total accept states = 4, backup states = 2
Original state number was 11, minimized machine has 9 states
Nextstate table compression was 84.81%, 350 entries Vs 2,304

Backup state report --- 
In <0>, after "0" automaton could accept "{intVal}" in state 1
--- after ''\0'' automaton is in a non-accept state and might need to backup

In <0>, after "A" automaton could accept "{Identifier}" in state 2
--- after '','' automaton is in a non-accept state and might need to backup
